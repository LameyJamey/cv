        <p> Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to look through my code file and the website as
            the result. Just a little about myself. I was born April 26th, 1998. My hobbies are reading, coding,
            and drawing. The last two of those, I am trying to make into my career. This very page is the first one
            I am doing on my own. To become familier with the process of writing out the code and such. Am I enjoying
            this all? Well, yes I am; and I am aiming to become great at it. Especially my art. </p>
